## 🛡️ Okta OIDC RBAC Authorization Lab
## 🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with OIDC & Custom Claims

This lab demonstrates how to implement group-based authorization using:

Okta OIDC (Authorization Code Flow)

Custom ID Token claims

Authorization Server configuration

Group-to-role mapping

JWT validation

The goal was to dynamically inject RBAC group membership into an ID token and validate access logic based on that claim.
